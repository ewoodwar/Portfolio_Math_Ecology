# Portfolio_Math_Ecology
This is the coding portion of my Math Ecology Portfolio
In this portfolio I demostrate my understanding of and extensions to "Introduction to Math Ecology", a course taught by Dr. Frithjof Lutscher at the University of Ottawa. 
This portion contains samply code, either created fully by me or created in part by others, that explores some of the main topics of the class. The folders in this repository correspond to the different chapters of Mark Kot's "Elements of Math Ecology".
